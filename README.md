# SST
## Introduction
This is our implementation of our paper *Spectrum-Spatio-Temporal Causal Debiasing for Class-Incremental Audio-Visual Video Recognition*.


## Usage

##### 1. Install dependencies
First we recommend to create a conda environment with all the required packages by using the following command.
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This command creates a conda environment named `TPPNet`. You can activate the conda environment with the following command:
```
Please install the dependencies according to the requirements.txt file.
```

##### 2. Run code

    ```
    Training phase:python train.py 
    ```
    ```
    Testing phase:python test.py 
    ```
